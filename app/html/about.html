    <p>Repairing your own small engine powered machinery can be dangerous and, ultimately, more expensive than having a highly trained professional do it. These engines are increasingly complex machines. Adjustments and replacements must be made with great care and to fine tolerences.</p>

    <p>At Maxwell Small Engine Repair we take great pride in providing quality work at a fair price. Your work is available when we promise and we NEVER perform unneeded repairs. There is a difference in repair shops.</p>

    <p>Let us prove it!</p>
